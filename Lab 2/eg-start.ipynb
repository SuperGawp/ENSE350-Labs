Which data structure might be useful to keep track of a row of different values, e.g. an `x`, `y`, `quot`, `rem`, `s` and `t`? Try using code to generate only the first row or two of the list, then try to turn it into a looping (or recursive) algorithm. Once the process terminates and the list is generated correctly, then it's simply a matter of returning the correct values from the data structure.\n",
